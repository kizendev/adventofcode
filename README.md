## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. Each day, a new coding puzzle is released, and participants are challenged to solve it using their programming skills. The puzzles are designed to be fun and engaging, covering a wide range of topics and difficulty levels.

To learn more about Advent of Code and participate in the challenges, visit the official website: [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).
